# hello-world
my demo repository where I'm following the help directions

I triiiied to make a sandbox repository without having read or followed these instructions (although I do really like the youtube video I was following). And then I ran into trouble! So here I am. 

Now I'm adding some stuff to this file so that I can play around with the behavior in the diff and make some suggestions and commnets.
